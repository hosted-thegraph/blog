# Blog - weekly 2022-06-29

## Done last week

- set up tool stack on local k8s cluster (minikube)
- ordered server for dedicated k8s cluster
- deployed graph node to k8s cluster and connected it to alchemy (polygon testnet)
- integrated frontend to allow:
  - project creation
  - auth token generation
  - save token for graph-cli to use it
- deployed 2 test subgraphs and so far it seems to be working
- starting with auth proxy
- talked to one potential customer

### Challenges

- CLI returns URL with non-standard HTTP port (8000)
- issues with setting up the virtual server with k8s
- kubernetes ingress nginx controller don't support our need of auth, we need an alternative
- sometimes subgraphs don't get indexed directly, need to investigate

## To do next week

- watch usage of node service
- finish dedicated k8s setup
- extent frontend application
- PR to graph CLI regarding port issue
- finish auth proxy
- add chains Optimism, optimism testnet, polygon (one graph node each)
- talk to more potential customer
- onboard potential customer to our test setup, get real feedback
- discuss user management (intern & extern user)
- discuss secret management
