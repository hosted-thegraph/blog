# Blog - weekly 2022-07-06

## Done last week

- holiday
- watched usage of node service
- dedicated k8s done
- continued with frontend
  - subgraph viewer (init, create, ...)
- working auth proxy for admin endpoint
- now 4 chains (optimism and polygon with testnets)
- talked to two more pot customers
- extend dashboard for graph nodes for visib
- not optional but safe secret management
- deployed 3 subgraphs (hop protocol pol-mum, opt)

### Challenges

- use more node service requests than we thought
- graph nodes not running efficient (problems with indexing)
- disk size of database
- syncing of new subgraph does not start until node restarted
- existing subgraphs takes long to sync, just stop until node gets restarted

### What went good?

- Balaton!
- Dashboard gives great insight of what happens and what are problems
- ArgoCD very helps us to automate stuff

## To do next week

- working on graph node problems
- solve disk 'issue'
- take a look on IPFS setup
- expand the dashboard
- streamline user experience when creating new subgraph
  - expand user management
- research CI/CD for subraphs
- research low-hanging fruits - user need
- expand public documentation
- create demo recording video
- HackFS discussion
